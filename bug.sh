#!/bin/bash

# This script attempts to process a large file, but it may encounter issues due to the way it reads the data.

input_file="large_file.txt"

while IFS= read -r line; do
  # Process each line
  # ...
done < "$input_file"

# The issue is in the above while loop. Depending on the size of the file and how much memory is available, this loop may not be efficient or may even fail.

# Another potential issue is the lack of error handling. If the file does not exist or there are problems during the processing, the script will terminate abruptly without any information.

# A more robust version is shown below.
